# 11/17

I'd like this app to use graphql for my portolio
- [I will have to update existing auth queries for this](https://payloadcms.com/docs/graphql/overview)

I'm going to make the models now which are essentially posts with questions

Naming possiblities include: Survey, Daily Check-in, Check-in, Entry, Prompt

I feel like Survey and Question is the most straight forward so I'll probably do that

## Things I did
- [ ] Added `firstName` to `User`
- [ ] Added `lastName` to `User`


## Survey
```ts
{
  "id": string,
  "name": string,
  "status": null | 'started' | 'uncompleted' | 'completed',
  "surveyDate": now(),
}
```

## Question
- points earned is calculated via an `afterChange` hook
```ts
{
  "id": string,
  "status": null | 'started' | 'uncompleted' | 'completed',
  "pointsAvailable": number,
  "pointsEarned": number,
  "surveyId": relationship<Survey>
  "questionCategory": 'body' | 'mind' | 'spirit' | 'connection' | 'goals'
  "questionText": string,
  "questionAnswer": boolean | string | null,
  "required": boolean
}
```

## Example
Assume survey is created for survey ID 1
```ts
{
  id: 1,
  status: null,
  pointsAvailable: 0,
  pointsEarned: 0,
  surveyId: 1,
  questionText: "What is one goal you have set for yourself in writing?",
  questionAnswer: "Text entered by user",
  required: false
},
{
  id: 2,
  status: null,
  pointsAvailable: 5,
  pointsEarned: 5,
  surveyId: 1,
  questionText: "Did you complete a major goal today?",
  questionAnswer: true,
  required: true
},
```

## If we do it by question...
`questionAnswerAfterChangeHook`:
  - If `value` === true or truthy, `pointsEarned = pointsAvailable`

## If we do it by question category...
`questionAnswerAfterChangeHook`:
  - If `value` === true or truthy, `pointsEarned = pointsAvailable`
  - **IN UI:** Group questions by category, list points as per category


I'm thinking maybe a block makes more sense in a question so you can add multiple questions to a question(group)
