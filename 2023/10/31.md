## Next up... User Front-end
- [x] Add React Query
- [x] Add React Routing
- [x] Add React Hook Form

All if these are in APP_ROUTES
- [x] "/" is the landing page, see dailyG for example
- [x] "/signup" is the get started form
- [x] "/login" is the login
- [x] "/uni/verify?token={verifyToken}" needs to be set up with the /uni/ things for mobile
- [x] "/dashboard" is where the user lands after login

React Query is already set up with the URLs I need to start the login process so that is where I will start today

My access isn't working as an admin to delete User accounts, the request is nto coming with a user object. Please look into ASAP

Also need to consider appending an email to users

## Next up... Solidify that workflow sis
- [ ] Unauthenticated Forgot Password / Reset Password
- [ ] Authenticated Account Page
  - [ ] Includes reset password
- [ ] After signing up, add a button to resend verification email
- [x] After verifying email, send user to login page
  - Payload doesn't mention if a user is already verified, just throws an error that the token isn't valid.
  - I can pass the user into the email, so append that ID to the URL and do a look up of the user. Add the verification state to state.
    - If an error comes back, check if verified.
      - If not, offer a resend email link.
- [ ] Fix Admin role access issue
