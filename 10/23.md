- [ ] Need to get app running
- [ ] Make sure tests pass
- [ ] Update account page to have a link to reset password
- [ ] Update node version for UI
- [ ] Move Lib to trusted publisher: https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers



## Setting project up locally

In ui you need to create an .env.local file that sets the REACT_APP_API_URL to whatever PORT the payload server will run at

In the API (payload) you need to set .env.development up setting the following:
- DATABASE_URI
- PAYLOAD_SECRET
- PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_APP_URL
- NODE_ENV
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- PAYLOAD_CLOUD
- PAYLOAD_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT
- PAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
- PAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID
- PAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID
- PAYLOAD_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID
- PAYLOAD_CLOUD_BUCKET
- PAYLOAD_CLOUD_BUCKET_REGION
- PAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_PASSWORD
- PORT

Most of the info is available on PayloadCMS settings page for this project.
