## Next up... User Front-end
- [x] Add React Query
- [x] Add React Routing
- [x] Add React Hook Form

All if these are in APP_ROUTES
- [x] "/" is the landing page, see dailyG for example
- [ ] "/signup" is the get started form
- [ ] "/login" is the login
- [x] "/uni/verify?token={verifyToken}" needs to be set up with the /uni/ things for mobile
- [ ] "/dashboard" is where the user lands after login

React Query is already set up with the URLs I need to start the login process so that is where I will start today
